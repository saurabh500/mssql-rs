//! Timeout state tracking for bulk copy operations.
//!
//! This module provides the `BulkCopyTimeoutState` struct that tracks timeout
//! state during bulk copy operations, including attention packet handling.
//!
//! The timeout mechanism follows the same pattern as Microsoft.Data.SqlClient's
//! SqlBulkCopy implementation:
//! - Operation timeout is tracked from the start of the bulk copy
//! - When timeout expires, an attention packet is sent to cancel the operation
//! - A separate 5-second timeout is used for waiting on the attention ACK
//! - If no attention ACK is received within 5 seconds, the connection is marked broken

use std::time::{Duration, Instant};

use crate::error::Error;

/// Default timeout for waiting on attention acknowledgment from the server.
/// This matches the behavior of Microsoft.Data.SqlClient's `AttentionTimeoutSeconds = 5`.
pub const ATTENTION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS: u64 = 5;

/// Tracks timeout state for bulk copy operations.
///
/// This struct manages the timeout deadline and attention packet state during
/// bulk copy operations. It follows the same pattern as SqlClient's timeout
/// handling in TdsParserStateObject.
///
/// # Timeout Flow
///
/// 1. When bulk copy starts, a deadline is set based on `timeout_sec`
/// 2. During writes, `is_expired()` is checked periodically
/// 3. If expired and no attention sent yet, `attention_sent` is set and attention is sent
/// 4. After sending attention, `set_attention_timeout()` sets a 5-second deadline
/// 5. If attention ACK not received within 5 seconds, connection is marked broken
///
/// # Error Preservation
///
/// When attention is sent, existing errors are stored in `pre_attention_errors`
/// and restored after attention processing. This ensures error information
/// is not lost during the attention handling sequence.
