//! Lazy arming of the remaining-request-timeout budget.
//!
//! See [`await_within_request_timeout`].

/// Awaits `$fut` under the remaining request budget `$budget`
/// (an `Option<Duration>`), arming a timer only if `$fut` suspends.
///
/// `tokio::time::Timeout::poll` polls the inner future *before* the delay, so a
/// future that is ready on its first poll returns `Ok` without the timer ever
/// being observed. Polling once up front and only then constructing the
/// `timeout` is therefore observationally identical, and skips the cost of
/// arming a timer for every row served from an already-buffered packet (#271).
///
/// That cost is not a timer-wheel registration: on the ready path the eager
/// form never polls the `Sleep`, so no wheel entry is ever created. It is the
/// `Instant::now()` clock read plus building the `Sleep`, and — because
/// `timeout` takes its future by value — moving the multi-kilobyte
/// `CancelHandle::run_until_cancelled` future around the row decode into
/// `Timeout<F>`. Pinning first and passing `Pin<&mut F>` avoids the move as well
/// as the timer.
///
/// Because that dominant term scales with the size of the inner future, an
/// isolated micro-benchmark on a trivial future understates it. In a paired
/// A/B benchmark after the packet-reader de-boxing merged in #264, this saves
/// ~254 ns per 48-column row, about 15% of the isolated decode cost.
///
/// The condition is *suspension*, deliberately not "the budget is zero".
/// `update_remaining_timeout` saturates to `Duration::ZERO` rather than `None`,
/// so an exhausted budget still arrives as `Some(ZERO)`; skipping the timer for
/// it would turn a fetch that must fail with `Elapsed` into an unbounded wait.
///
/// This is a macro rather than a function so that it expands at the call site.
/// The same logic behind an `async fn` measures ~4% slower, because an `async
/// fn` that awaits inside one match arm stores that arm's future in its state
/// machine, growing the per-row future and paying a memcpy on every move.
///
/// On the suspending path `$fut` is polled once more than it would be today
/// (once by this macro, then again by `Timeout`'s first poll) and the deadline
/// starts from after that poll rather than before it. Both are permitted:
/// futures must tolerate spurious polls, and the shift is one poll of CPU time
/// against a budget measured in seconds. It does not change the verdict on an
/// exhausted budget either, because `sleep(ZERO)` is itself `Pending` on its
/// first poll, so eager `timeout` grants that same extra poll.
