Integration tests for FedAuth (Access Token) authentication using the mock TDS server.

This test validates that the mssql-py-core driver correctly sends access tokens
to the SQL Server using FedAuth (Federated Authentication) protocol.

The mock TDS server Python bindings (mssql-mock-tds-py) are used to verify
that the server received the exact access token that was sent.

Usage:
