//! Asynchronous connection API for the Core TDS backend.
//!
//! # ⚠️ Preview API — unstable
//!
//! The types and methods in this module are **not** part of the stable
//! `mssql-py-core` surface. Signatures, error behavior, and internal
//! semantics may change without notice in any release. First use in a
//! Python process emits a [`FutureWarning`] via `warnings.warn`.
//!
//! Sibling of `connection.rs` (the synchronous surface). Every type defined
//! here submits its I/O to the shared process-wide Tokio runtime via
//! [`crate::async_runtime`] and returns Python awaitables through
//! `pyo3_async_runtimes::tokio::future_into_py`, so callers can `await` the
//! results from `asyncio`.
//!
//! Invariant: one async connection maps to exactly one async cursor, one
//! `TdsClient`, and one TDS wire session.
//!
//! [`FutureWarning`]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#FutureWarning
