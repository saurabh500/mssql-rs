# Implementation Plan — Typed & Columnar Fetch (mssql-odbc)

Tracking: ADO User Story [46375](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46375) (`mssql-odbc | Typed & columnar fetch`), under Feature [42845](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/42845).

## Goal

Make the Rust `mssql-odbc` driver (a drop-in replacement for `msodbcsql18` that wraps `mssql-tds`) implement the result-fetch ODBC ABI that the `mssql-python` C++ pybind layer calls, so `mssql-odbc` can replace the bundled `msodbcsql18` underneath `mssql-python`.

Reference: `rust_odbc_for_python_driver.docx` §4.5.1 (fetch type map) and §4.8 (batch fetch / insert).

## The real consumer / contract

- `mssql-python` is a C++ pybind layer (`mssql_python/pybind/ddbc_bindings.cpp`) that dynamically loads an ODBC driver and exposes DB-API 2.0. It is **not** built on `mssql-py-core` (the separate pure-Rust pyo3 driver on `mssql-tds`).
- The exact fetch behavior `mssql-odbc` must provide is defined by what `ddbc_bindings.cpp` calls; `msodbcsql` is only the behavioral reference.
- Driver load in `ddbc_bindings.cpp` **requires** these function pointers to be non-null or it aborts: `SQLFetchScroll`, `SQLGetData`, `SQLNumResultCols`, `SQLBindCol`, `SQLDescribeColW`, `SQLMoreResults`, `SQLColAttributeW`, `SQLSetStmtAttrW`. Several of these are missing today, so `mssql-odbc` would not even load under `mssql-python` before this work.

## Two fetch paths mssql-python drives

1. **Columnar / bound** (`fetchmany` / `fetchall`, §4.8): `SQLSetStmtAttr(SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE = N)` + `SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR`, then `SQLBindCol` per column into typed C arrays (column-wise, default `SQL_BIND_BY_COLUMN`), then one `SQLFetchScroll(SQL_FETCH_NEXT)` per block. Forward-only, read-only. It calls `SQLFreeStmt(SQL_UNBIND)` before each fetch.
2. **Row-by-row** (`fetchone`, LOB, `sql_variant`, §4.7): `SQLFetch` + typed `SQLGetData` per column.

Both paths must share one conversion core: `ColumnValues -> requested SQL_C_* target`.

## Fetch type map (§4.5.1) — SQL type → C type mssql-python requests

| SQL type | C type | Python |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`, `LONGVARCHAR` | `SQL_C_WCHAR` (default) or `SQL_C_CHAR` | `str` |
| `WCHAR`, `WVARCHAR`, `WLONGVARCHAR` | `SQL_C_WCHAR` | `str` |
| `SS_XML` | `SQL_C_WCHAR` (streamed) | `str` |
| `TINYINT` | `SQL_C_TINYINT` | `int` |
| `SMALLINT` | `SQL_C_SSHORT` | `int` |
| `INTEGER` | `SQL_C_SLONG` | `int` |
| `BIGINT` | `SQL_C_SBIGINT` | `int` |
| `BIT` | `SQL_C_BIT` | `bool` |
| `REAL` | `SQL_C_FLOAT` | `float` |
| `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE` | `SQL_C_DOUBLE` | `float` |
| `DECIMAL`, `NUMERIC` | `SQL_C_CHAR` (parsed) | `decimal.Decimal` |
| `TYPE_DATE` | `SQL_C_TYPE_DATE` | `datetime.date` |
| `TYPE_TIME`, `SS_TIME2` | `SQL_C_SS_TIME2` | `datetime.time` |
| `TIMESTAMP`, `TYPE_TIMESTAMP`, `DATETIME` | `SQL_C_TYPE_TIMESTAMP` | `datetime.datetime` |
| `SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET` | `SQL_C_SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET` | `datetime` (tz-aware) |
| `BINARY`, `VARBINARY`, `LONGVARBINARY`, `SS_UDT` | `SQL_C_BINARY` | `bytes` |
| `GUID` | `SQL_C_GUID` | `uuid.UUID` |
| `SS_VARIANT` | probe via `SQL_C_BINARY`, then map to underlying type | base type |

### sql_variant handling

`ddbc_bindings.cpp` first calls `SQLGetData(col, SQL_C_BINARY, NULL, 0, &ind)` as a probe (detects NULL and initializes variant metadata), then `SQLColAttribute(col, SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE, ..., &ctype)`. So `SQLColAttributeW` **must** support `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE` (`1215`) — it is the only `SQLColAttribute` field `mssql-python` uses for fetch.

### Relevant SQL Server constants

`SQL_SS_XML = -152`, `SQL_SS_UDT = -151`, `SQL_SS_VARIANT = -150`, `SQL_SS_TIME2 = -154`, `SQL_SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET = -155`, `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE = 1215`, `SQL_C_SS_TIME2 = 0x4000`, `SQL_C_SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET = 0x4001`. Note: `mssql-python` does not set `SQL_ATTR_ROW_STATUS_PTR`; it relies on `SQL_ATTR_ROWS_FETCHED_PTR` plus per-column indicators.

## Starting state (before this work)

- `SQLGetData` (`get_data.rs`): only `SQL_C_CHAR` / `SQL_C_WCHAR`, text conversion of a **subset** of `ColumnValues` (`TinyInt`, `SmallInt`, `Int`, `BigInt`, `Real`, `Float`, `Bit`, `String`, `Uuid`). Missing: `Decimal`/`Numeric`, all date/time types, `Bytes`, `Money`/`SmallMoney`, `Xml`, `Json`, `Vector`. No chunked-offset streaming (repeated calls return the same prefix).
- `SQLFetch` (`fetch.rs`): row-by-row firehose only (`client.next_row` via `block_on`), stores `stmt_state.current_row`.
- `SQLBindCol`, `SQLFetchScroll`, `SQLColAttributeW`: not implemented / not exported.
- `SQLSetStmtAttrW` / `SQLGetStmtAttrW`: no-op stubs returning `SQL_SUCCESS`, so `SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE` / `ROWS_FETCHED_PTR` / `PARAMSET_SIZE` were ignored.
- `SQLDescribeColW` (`describe_col.rs`): implemented, with type mapping + column size / decimal digits.

## Phased plan

### P0 — Prerequisites & plumbing — Task [46577](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46577)

- Add all `SQL_C_*` constants + SQL Server extension type ids and the C interop structs (`SQL_DATE_STRUCT`, `SQL_TIME_STRUCT`, `SQL_TIMESTAMP_STRUCT`, `SQL_SS_TIME2_STRUCT`, `SQL_SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET_STRUCT`, `SQLGUID`, `SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT`) to `api/odbc_types.rs`.
- Extend `StmtState` (`handles/stmt.rs`) with the block-fetch controls: `row_array_size`, `rows_fetched_ptr`, `row_status_ptr`, `row_bind_type`. (The column-bindings vector and rowset buffer land with P3, and the per-column `SQLGetData` offset with P1, where they are consumed.)
- Implement real `SQLSetStmtAttrW` / `SQLGetStmtAttrW` that honor the rowset controls. `SQL_ATTR_CURSOR_TYPE` / `SQL_ATTR_CONCURRENCY` accept only the supported forward-only / read-only values and substitute+warn (`01S02`) otherwise; `SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE` accepts 1 and rejects larger batches; unknown identifiers fail with `HY092`. `SQL_ATTR_APP_PARAM_DESC` requires a descriptor subsystem and is deferred (see scope boundary below).
- Covered by unit tests only (safe-core logic at ~97% line coverage). E2e tests are intentionally deferred to P1: the P0 statement attributes are ARD/APD descriptor-backed and intercepted by the unixODBC Driver Manager, so they are not meaningfully observable through the DM until a fetch path consumes them.

### P1 — Typed SQLGetData (row-by-row) — Task [46578](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46578)

- Build the shared `ColumnValues -> requested SQL_C_*` conversion core (reused by `SQLBindCol` in P3).
- Start with int types (existing child task [46404](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46404)) and int→char/wchar (existing child task [46405](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46405)), then floats, decimal/numeric (→ `SQL_C_CHAR`), strings, binary, guid, date/time/timestamp/time2/timestampoffset, money, xml, json/vector.
- Add chunked-offset streaming so repeated `SQLGetData` calls advance (`01004` + `SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO` reporting remaining length). **Moved out of P1** — chunked retrieval and incremental PLP streaming are owned by the fetch rework in [#153](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-rs/pull/153) (column-wise fetch + incremental PLP), which uses ODBC wire-stream state rather than an offset over a materialized value. P1 returns each value in a single call and reports truncation with `01004`.
- Implement `sql_variant` probe semantics (`SQL_C_BINARY` NULL detection + variant metadata init).
- **Binary targets regressed out of P1 and are not implemented.** `SQL_C_BINARY` was implemented alongside the chunked-offset streaming, so removing that streaming (ceding it to [#153](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-rs/pull/153)) took `SQL_C_BINARY` with it; the target gate in `write_captured_column` now rejects it with `HYC00`. Separately, binary → character (hex rendering) has never been implemented in any phase: `ColumnValues::Bytes` has no `column_value_to_text` arm. Note that the e2e test `GetDataLiveTest.UnsupportedColumnTypeHyc00PreservesValue` is currently anchored on `VARBINARY(8)` being unconvertible, so implementing binary → char requires re-pointing it (see the maintenance note in that test).
- Add the e2e coverage deferred from P0: a `set_stmt_attr_test.cpp` (parity with `set_env_attr_test.cpp`) plus a live-connection test that drives typed `SQLGetData` through the Driver Manager. P0's statement attributes (`SQL_ATTR_ROW_ARRAY_SIZE`, etc.) are descriptor-backed and intercepted by unixODBC, so they are only meaningfully observable end-to-end once a fetch path consumes them here (block fetch lands in P3).

### P1a — Mandatory source-type conversions — Task [47107](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/47107)

ODBC Appendix D requires a driver to support conversions to **all** ODBC C types from every SQL type it supports. P1 implemented the integer, floating-point, GUID and date/time targets, but only from a subset of sources. P1a added the missing source types, delivered in PR #217:

- `decimal` / `numeric` → the numeric C targets (`SQL_C_DOUBLE`, `SQL_C_FLOAT`, `SQL_C_SLONG`, `SQL_C_SBIGINT`, …). A `NumericSource` abstraction keeps the exact-decimal types exact instead of routing them through `f64`, so an integer target can report truncation rather than silently dropping a fraction.
- `money` / `smallmoney` → the numeric C targets, from their 10^4-scaled wire value.
- Character sources (`char` / `varchar` / `nchar` / `nvarchar`) → numeric and date/time C targets (`'123'` → `SQL_C_SLONG`, `'2023-06-15'` → `SQL_C_TYPE_DATE`). Decimal literals parse exactly, with an `f64` fallback for exponent forms; the `date` / `time` / `datetime2` / `datetimeoffset` character forms are all accepted. Text that is not a valid literal for the requested target returns `22018`, including a literal that parses as a different temporal shape (`'12:00'` into `SQL_C_TYPE_DATE`) and impossible calendar dates (`'2023-02-31'`).
- Lossy **numeric** conversions report fractional truncation with `01S07` + `SQL_SUCCESS_WITH_INFO` (`float` `1234.99` → `SQL_C_SLONG` yields `1234` + `01S07`), reusing the `ConvOk::Truncated` plumbing P1 introduced for date/time targets that discard a component.

A source with no interpretation for the requested target (binary, guid) is `07006`, since that pairing is illegal rather than unimplemented.

Max-length character sources (`varchar(max)` / `nvarchar(max)`) into the numeric and date/time targets are **excluded** from P1a and tracked as Task [47238](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/47238). They arrive as PLP, so parsing needs the ODBC layer to accumulate chunks, which inverts the "never buffer the full PLP payload" invariant that `stream_active_plp_chunk` documents. That work is sequenced after #204 and #215, which are both rewriting the same read path, and needs a bounded-prefix policy agreed first so a 2 GB column cannot be drained to produce a `SQL_C_SLONG`.

#### Known divergences from msodbcsql

These were found by reading `Sql/Ntdbms/sqlncli/odbc/sqlccnvt.cpp` while reviewing P1a. They are recorded here because `GetDataLiveTest` skips the msodbcsql comparison leg for these cases, so the parity run will not surface them.

| Case | msodbcsql | mssql-odbc | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A UTC offset in a literal, for any target other than `SQL_C_SS_TIMESTAMPOFFSET` | shifts the value into the client's local zone (`ConvertOffsetToLocal`) | validates the offset, then delivers the wall-clock fields as written | **Deliberate.** Matching would make the returned value depend on the client machine's time zone. Locked in by `offset_is_ignored_for_non_offset_targets`. |
| Character or decimal source into `SQL_C_TINYINT` above 127 | `22003` — the signed limit applies whenever the input type is not itself a tinyint C type | `Ok(200)` — the target is `u8`, matching a real `tinyint` column (0-255) and what mssql-python fetches | **Deliberate**, but P1a is what first opens these sources into that target, so the divergence starts here. |
| `YYYY/MM/DD` and the ODBC escape literals `{d '...'}` / `{t '...'}` / `{ts '...'}` | accepted (`rgbECODE_DATE_SLASH` retry, and the `FindECode` branch) | `22018` | Gap — Task [47246](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/47246). |
| `T` separator, `HH:MM` without seconds, unpadded fields such as `2023-6-5` | rejected (fixed-length token grammar) | accepted | Permissive. Low risk, same task. |
| A time-only value into `SQL_C_TYPE_TIMESTAMP` | fills in the current date and succeeds, per Appendix D | `22018` from a character source, `07006` from a `time` column | Gap — Task [47247](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/47247). Needs a platform-specific local-date helper, so it is not a one-line fix. |
| Any source into `SQL_C_NUMERIC` | converts, per Appendix D | `HYC00` | **Deliberate, and permanent.** Decimal is delivered as character data, which is what mssql-python requests, so `SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT` is not scheduled to become supported. Anchored by `UnsupportedCTypeReturnsHyc00ThenValueReadable`. |
| `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE` for a variant holding `decimal` / `numeric` / `money` | `SQL_C_NUMERIC` | `SQL_C_CHAR` | **Deliberate**, and follows from the row above: reporting `SQL_C_NUMERIC` would make the caller request a `SQL_NUMERIC_STRUCT` this driver refuses. Character is how those values are actually delivered. |
| `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE` on a column that is not `sql_variant` | `SQL_SUCCESS` | `HY113` | **Deliberate.** msodbcsql prepares `IDS_S1_113` and then `break`s without returning it, where the adjacent `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_SERVER_TYPE` case does `SETRC_SERR_GOTO` with the same error — so its success looks like an oversight rather than a contract. Telling the caller it asked the wrong question is more useful than answering it. |
| `SQL_DESC_DATETIME_INTERVAL_CODE` through `SQLColAttribute` | rejected — the field is not in the `GetIRDField` switch | `SQL_CODE_TIMESTAMP` for the `datetime`/`smalldatetime`/`datetime2` family, `0` otherwise | **Deliberate**, and additive. Having collapsed `SQL_DESC_TYPE` to the verbose `SQL_DATETIME` to match msodbcsql, refusing to say which member it was leaves the caller with strictly less information than before. Anchored by `DatetimeSubtypeAccompaniesTheVerboseType`, which skips the comparison leg. |

##### Descriptor fields verified against msodbcsql

The per-type tables behind `SQL_DESC_DISPLAY_SIZE`, `SQL_DESC_OCTET_LENGTH`, `SQL_DESC_PRECISION`, `SQL_DESC_UNSIGNED` and `SQL_DESC_SEARCHABLE` were taken from `GetIRDField` in `Sql/Ntdbms/sqlncli/odbc/sqlcdesc.cpp` and are asserted on *both* legs of the parity run, so they are checked against the real driver rather than against a reading of it. Three are easy to get wrong:

- **Display size is not the column size.** An `int` is 11 (sign plus ten digits), a GUID is 36, binary is two hex characters per byte, and the national character types report characters while their octet length reports bytes.
- **Octet length is the ODBC transfer size, not the TDS payload width.** A `date` is 3 bytes on the wire but transfers as a 6-byte `SQL_DATE_STRUCT`; `time` is 12, the `datetime` family 16, and `datetimeoffset` 20. Reporting the wire width would have callers allocate short.
- **`SQL_DESC_UNSIGNED` keys off the ODBC type, not the TDS type.** msodbcsql's `IsUnsigned()` is a bitmask over the *SQL* type, so it is `SQL_FALSE` only for the signed numerics and `SQL_TRUE` for every nonnumeric column. `money` therefore comes out **signed**, because it is reported as `SQL_DECIMAL` — which is the one case a TDS-type-based implementation gets backwards.

### P2 — SQLColAttributeW — Task [46579](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46579)

- Required minimum: `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE` so the `sql_variant` underlying C type resolves after the `SQL_C_BINARY` probe.
- Plus common descriptor fields (type / concise type, length, octet length, precision, scale, name, unsigned, nullable, display size) reusing the `SQLDescribeColW` metadata mapping.
- Export `SQLColAttributeW` (driver-load requires the pointer non-null).

Reading a `sql_variant` column takes three things, not one, and mssql-python needs all of them before it will produce a value — on any failure it logs and yields `None` for the column, so a missing link shows up as silently empty data rather than an error:

1. `SQLDescribeCol` must report `SQL_SS_VARIANT`. mssql-python branches on that exact type; while the column was reported as `SQL_VARCHAR` it never entered the variant path at all.
2. `SQLGetData(col, SQL_C_BINARY, NULL, 0, &indicator)` must succeed. This is a length/NULL probe, not a data read; it is admitted while binary delivery stays unimplemented (a real buffer is still `HYC00`, tracked as Task [47239](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/47239)).
3. `SQLColAttribute(SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE)` returns the C type of the value just probed.

The underlying type is a property of the **value**, not the column — a variant column can hold a different type in every row — so it is carried up from the decoder rather than derived from metadata: `RowWriter` gained a defaulted `write_variant_base_type`, `CursorColumn::Value` carries the base type alongside the value, and `StmtState` clears it with the rest of the row-stream state. `ColumnValues` is deliberately untouched, which is what keeps this change out of the Python and Node bindings.

### P3 — SQLBindCol + block SQLFetchScroll — Task [46580](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46580)

- `SQLBindCol`: store per-column binding (col, target C type, buffer ptr, buffer len, indicator ptr); support unbind (null ptr) and `SQLFreeStmt(SQL_UNBIND)`.
- `SQLFetchScroll(SQL_FETCH_NEXT)`: fetch up to `row_array_size` rows into a rowset; fill each bound-column array + indicator array (default column-wise); set `*rows_fetched_ptr`; return `SQL_NO_DATA` at end with partial-rowset handling. Forward-only.
- Reuse the P1 conversion core. Ensure `SQLGetData` still works after a bound fetch (mixed access).
- Export `SQLBindCol` and `SQLFetchScroll`.

### P4 — Exports & driver-load compatibility — Task [46581](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46581)

- Export `SQLBindCol`, `SQLFetchScroll`, `SQLColAttributeW` (exact names incl. the `W` variant) so `ddbc_bindings.cpp` `GetFunctionPointer` succeeds.
- Verify the full required symbol set is present and the driver loads under `mssql-python`.

### P5 — Testing & end-to-end validation — Task [46582](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46582)

- Unit tests per conversion (`ColumnValues` → each `SQL_C_*` target; NULL / indicator / truncation).
- Integration tests against SQL Server (Docker) exercising every type via the ODBC C ABI, both bound (`SQLFetchScroll`) and row-by-row (`SQLGetData`) paths.
- End-to-end: run the `mssql-python` test suite against a locally-swapped `mssql-odbc` build.

## Scope boundary — batch insert

§4.8 also covers **batch insert** (`executemany` via `SQL_ATTR_PARAMSET_SIZE` array binding), which is a **write** path and out of scope for this story. It is tracked separately as User Story [46576](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46576) (`mssql-odbc | Batch insert (executemany array binding)`), with dependencies on Parameter completeness ([46373](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46373)), Descriptors ([46374](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46374)), Connection & statement attributes ([46377](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46377)), and Streaming ([46378](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46378)).

## Scope boundary — descriptors (`SQL_ATTR_APP_PARAM_DESC` / `SQL_C_NUMERIC` input binding)

Descriptor handles are not implemented in the crate yet, so `SQLGetStmtAttrW(SQL_ATTR_APP_PARAM_DESC)` currently returns `HY092`. `mssql-python`'s `ddbc_bindings.cpp` calls this (then `SQLSetDescField` on the returned handle) only when binding a `SQL_C_NUMERIC` **input parameter**, and aborts the bind if it fails — so numeric input-parameter binding will not work until a descriptor subsystem exists. There is no correct minimal shim (a non-null fake handle would crash `SQLSetDescField`). This is deferred to the Descriptors work item [46374](https://sqlclientdrivers.visualstudio.com/mssql-rs/_workitems/edit/46374) (APD handle alloc/free, `SQLGetStmtAttr` returning it, and `SQLSetDescField` support for `SQL_DESC_TYPE`/`SQL_DESC_CONCISE_TYPE`/precision/scale), rather than expanding this P0 plumbing PR.

## Scope boundary — chunked retrieval and incremental PLP (LOB) streaming

`SQLGetData` in P1 returns each value in a single call from the materialized `ColumnValues` that `TdsClient::next_row` produces, reporting truncation with `01004`. It does **not** advance a per-call offset, and it does not stream LOBs off the wire.

Both of those landed with the fetch rework in [#153](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-rs/pull/153) (column-wise fetch + incremental PLP support), which carries ODBC wire-stream state and builds on the PLP reader added in [#109](https://github.com/microsoft/mssql-rs/pull/109) (`PlpChunkStreamReader`, `receive_row_into` / `resume_row_into` / `read_active_plp_bytes`). Those primitives are `pub(crate)` to `mssql-tds`, and consuming them from the ODBC crate additionally requires a public `TdsClient` streaming API plus an ODBC connection-ownership change (today `SQLFetch` returns the TDS client to the DBC, whereas streaming requires the statement to hold it across `SQLGetData` calls). P1 therefore stays on the conversion layer and leaves the fetch mechanics to #153.

## Status

| Phase | Task | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 — Prerequisites & plumbing | 46577 | Implemented (build + clippy clean, 332 tests pass) |
| P1 — Typed SQLGetData | 46578 | Implemented (int/float/guid/date-time C targets + char/wchar rendering; 491 tests pass). Chunked retrieval and incremental PLP streaming are owned by #153 (merged), on top of which the typed targets are dispatched; missing source-type conversions tracked as P1a; `SQL_C_BINARY` and binary→char hex are **not** implemented (see the P1 section); `sql_variant` underlying-type resolution deferred to P2. |
| P1a — Mandatory source-type conversions | 47107 | Implemented (decimal, money and character sources into the numeric and date/time C targets; `01S07` on lossy numeric conversion, `22018` on an invalid character literal). |
| P2 — SQLColAttributeW | 46579 | Implemented (common descriptor fields + `SQL_CA_SS_VARIANT_TYPE`, plus the `SQL_SS_VARIANT` type mapping and the zero-length `SQL_C_BINARY` probe the variant path depends on). Binary *delivery* remains unimplemented (Task 47239). |
| P3 — SQLBindCol + SQLFetchScroll | 46580 | Not started |
| P4 — Exports & driver-load compat | 46581 | Not started |
| P5 — Testing & end-to-end | 46582 | Not started |
