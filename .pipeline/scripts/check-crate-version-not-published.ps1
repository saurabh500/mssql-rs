.SYNOPSIS
  Preflight guard for the sandbox crate release flow.

.DESCRIPTION
  Fails (exit 1) when a crate version about to be published is already present
  in the Azure Artifacts Cargo registry, so the pipeline fails in seconds
  instead of building and only hitting cargo's duplicate-version rejection at
  `cargo publish`.

  The mssql-rs_Public feed allows anonymous reads, so the PEP-equivalent Cargo
  sparse index is queried without credentials. Each crate's index file is
  newline-delimited JSON, one object per published version.

  Best-effort: if the registry cannot be reached (auth/network), the script
  WARNs and exits 0. cargo's duplicate-version rejection at publish time remains
  the authoritative guard, so a transient lookup failure never blocks a release.
