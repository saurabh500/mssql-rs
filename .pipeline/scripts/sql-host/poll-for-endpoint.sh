# poll-for-endpoint.sh — block until the matching SQL host has published its
# "sql-ready" sentinel artifact, then download it and export the SQL endpoint
# (host + port) as pipeline variables for downstream test steps.
#
# This is the symmetric counterpart of wait-for-teardown.sh on the SQL host
# side. Both jobs run concurrently (no ADO `dependsOn` between them, which
# would deadlock — ADO won't start a dependent job until its upstream
# completes, and the SQL host can only complete after tests finish). The two
# jobs rendezvous via pipeline-artifact sentinels in both directions:
#   * SQL host -> Test:  sql-ready-<instanceId>-<stageAttempt>  (endpoint)
#   * Test    -> SQL host: <sentinelName>-<stageAttempt>        (one per entry)
# The -<stageAttempt> (System.StageAttempt) suffix namespaces the rendezvous
# per stage attempt so a rerun forms a fresh handshake instead of colliding
# with or reading a prior attempt's artifacts. Set ARTIFACT_NAME accordingly.
#
# Required env:
#   ARTIFACT_NAME         Name of the sql-ready sentinel artifact.
#   BUILD_BUILDID
#   SYSTEM_COLLECTIONURI
#   SYSTEM_TEAMPROJECT
#   SYSTEM_ACCESSTOKEN    Expose via env: in the YAML step.
#   AGENT_TEMPDIRECTORY
#
# Optional env:
#   POLL_INTERVAL_SECONDS    default 10
#   MAX_WAIT_SECONDS         default 3600 (60 min). Covers x64 agent queueing,
#                            docker pull, and SQL Server startup.
#   SYSTEM_STAGEATTEMPT      current stage attempt (ADO provides it). Used only
#                            to detect a partial "Rerun failed jobs" and emit
#                            guidance to rerun the whole stage instead.
#   RERUN_HINT_AFTER_SECONDS default 600. On attempt > 1, how long to wait with
#                            no endpoint before warning that the SQL host job
#                            was probably not restarted.
#
# Sets pipeline variables on success:
#   DB_HOST   IP advertised by the SQL host
#   DB_PORT   port advertised by the SQL host
