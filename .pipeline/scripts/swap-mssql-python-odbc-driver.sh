# Replace the Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 binary that mssql-python ships with the
# Rust mssql-odbc driver, so the upstream test suite exercises our driver.
#
# mssql-python resolves its driver entirely in native code
# (ddbc_bindings GetOdbcLibsBaseDir / GetDriverPathCpp): it takes the
# mssql_python_odbc package directory and appends
#   libs/<platform>/<arch>/lib/libmsodbcsql-<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.so.2.1
# where MAJOR.MINOR comes from mssql_python_odbc.__version__ at build time. So
# overwriting that one file is enough to redirect the whole suite - no
# mssql-python source change, no odbcinst registration, no LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
#
# Any copy of mssql_python_odbc installed into site-packages is swapped too, so
# the result does not depend on which one wins on sys.path.
#
# Env:
#   MSSQL_ODBC_DRIVER   Path to the built libmsodbcsql18.so (required).
#   MSSQL_PYTHON_DIR    mssql-python checkout (default: /workspace).
