# Build tests with GSSAPI feature enabled.
# With the new dlopen-based implementation, there's no compile-time dependency on krb5.
# GSSAPI support is loaded at runtime via dlopen - if libgssapi_krb5.so is not installed,
# is_gssapi_available() returns false and Kerberos auth gracefully fails.
# This matches ODBC's approach: no compile-time linking, runtime detection.
#
# IMPORTANT: Must use -C target-feature=-crt-static to enable dynamic linking.
# Rust defaults to static linking on musl, but GSSAPI uses dlopen() to load
# the Kerberos library at runtime. Static binaries cannot use dlopen().
