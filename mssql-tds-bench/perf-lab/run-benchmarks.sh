# It builds the mssql-tds-bench harness TWICE from the SAME (candidate) working
# tree — so the harness code, Criterion version, and toolchain are identical —
# swapping ONLY the mssql-tds source:
#   * candidate: ../mssql-tds is the working tree
#   * baseline:  ../mssql-tds is replaced with a local `git worktree` checkout of
#                the commit pinned in baseline-commit.txt (no ADO auth on the VM)
# Any statistically significant delta is therefore attributable to mssql-tds.
